## Project Description

Our group came up with the idea of a Chore Tracker API to organize shared living responsibilities. The API will allow users to create and assign chores to roommates, track completion status, and leave comments on specific tasks. Users can search for specific chores, filter by progress, or search by roommates if they have multiple, making it easy to see what chores each one has. The API will also store all roommate and chore-related information for easy retrieval and organization.
